        <p>Praise Yah! Praise Yahweh, my soul. While I live, I will praise Yahweh. I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist. Don't put your trust in princes, each a son of man in whom there is no help. His spirit departs, and he returns to the earth. In that very day, his thoughts perish. </p>

        <p>Be merciful to me, God, be merciful to me, for my soul takes refuge in you. Yes, in the shadow of your wings, I will take refuge, until disaster has passed. I cry out to God Most High, to God who accomplishes my requests for me.</p>

        <p>He will send from heaven, and save me, he rebukes the one who is pursuing me. God will send out his loving kindness and his truth. My soul is among lions. I lie among those who are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.</p>

        <p>Praise Yahweh, all you nations! Extol him, all you peoples! For his loving kindness is great toward us. Yahweh's faithfulness endures forever. Praise Yah!</p>

        <p>Be exalted, God, above the heavens! Let your glory be above all the earth! They have prepared a net for my steps. My soul is bowed down. They dig a pit before me. They fall into its midst themselves.</p> 

        <p>My heart is steadfast, God, my heart is steadfast. I will sing, yes, I will sing praises. Wake up, my glory! Wake up, psaltery and harp! I will wake up the dawn. I will give thanks to you, LORD, among the peoples. I will sing praises to you among the nations.</p>

        <p>For your great loving kindness reaches to the heavens, and your truth to the skies. Be exalted, God, above the heavens. Let your glory be over all the earth.</p>

        <p>An oracle is within my heart about the disobedience of the wicked: «There is no fear of God before his eyes.» For he flatters himself in his own eyes, too much to detect and hate his sin.</p>
